            In the middle of 2019, I‚Äôve challenged myself to become a Web
            Developer and started to learn programming by myself üë©‚Äçüíª.
            <br />
            After a few months, of self-studying, I won a scholarship at Wild
            Code School and immediately enrolled for a 5-month Fullstack WebDev
            course. It was a great time during which I had a mixture of in-class
            and online learning, dojos and online challenges, attended
            workshops, 2 hackathons and worked on 3 projects. I gained lots of
            important tech skills, used SCRUM agile methodology with my team,
            and got experience working with a client on a real project.
            <br />
            <br />
            üíª Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, ReactJS,
            Material UI, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Git, Figma etc.
