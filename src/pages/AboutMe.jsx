              In the middle of 2019, I‚Äôve challenged myself to become a{" "}
              <Highlight>Web Developer</Highlight> and started to learn
              programming by myself üë©‚Äçüíª.
              <br />
              After a few months, of <Highlight>self-studying</Highlight>, I won
              a scholarship at Wild Code School and immediately enrolled for a{" "}
              <Highlight>5-month Fullstack WebDev course</Highlight>. It was a
              great time during which I had a mixture of in-class and online
              learning, dojos and online challenges, attended workshops, 2
              hackathons and worked on 3 projects. I gained lots of important
              tech skills, used SCRUM agile methodology with my team, and got
              experience working with a client on a real project.
              <br />
              <br />
              üíª Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, ReactJS,
              Material UI, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Git, Figma etc.
