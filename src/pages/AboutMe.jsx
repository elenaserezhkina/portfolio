              In the middle of 2019, I‚Äôve challenged myself to become a{" "}

            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              After a few months, of <Highlight>self-studying</Highlight>, I won
              a scholarship at Wild Code School and immediately enrolled for a{" "}
              <Highlight>5-month Fullstack WebDev course</Highlight>. It was a
              great time with a mixture of in-class and online learning, dojos
              and online challenges, workshops, hackathons and lots of projects
              where I gained important tech skills, used SCRUM agile methodology
              with my team, and got experience working with a client (Workademy)
              under WCS.

              üíª Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, ReactJS,
              Material UI, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Git, Figma etc.

              I enjoy solving challenges, learning something new, and I am
              looking for opportunities to further develop my programming
              skills. I want to find and contribute to the project that I would
              be passionate about.
